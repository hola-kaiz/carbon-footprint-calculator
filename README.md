# 🌍 Carbon Footprint Calculator

This is a simple and interactive Streamlit web app that estimates a user's **monthly carbon footprint** based on their lifestyle habits and routines.

## 🚀 Features

- Sleek and user-friendly interface with custom styling
- Gathers lifestyle-related inputs including:
  - Age and gender
  - Mode of transport
  - Daily activities like work, shopping, entertainment, social media, and more
- Calculates an estimated carbon footprint (in kgCO₂/month) using a basic weighted formula
- Lightweight and easy to run locally

## 🧠 How It Works

The app uses a basic formula to simulate a carbon footprint score. It takes into account various aspects like energy usage, transport method, physical activity, and other behaviors. Each input is weighted to reflect its approximate environmental impact. **Note:** This is a simplified model and not intended for accurate scientific calculations.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- NumPy
